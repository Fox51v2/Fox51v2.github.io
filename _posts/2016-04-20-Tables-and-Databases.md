## A Breezy Tutorial

First I will answer the question, "What is a table?" A table is a collection of data held in a structured format within a database. It is made up of both columns and rows. The next logical question would be as to what a database is.  A database is a collection of tables queries and other data.  We will get into queries later. The method that I prefer for creating tables and databases is to import an sql file. The command to import an sql file is 
"\i FILENAME.sql" but lets not get ahead of ourselves because we need to creat the file first.
